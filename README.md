### Hi, I'm Devin 👋
I'm an outgoing student from Calgary, Alberta with a passion for programming. <br/> <br/>
🎓&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm currently studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo and will be graduating with the class of 2025. <br/>
📈&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solving problems with code is what makes me tick and, consequently, it's a skill I am always finding ways to improve. <br/> 
🚡&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from programming, I enjoy the great outdoors! <br/> <br/>
***Note:***<br/>
I'm currently looking for a summer 2021 SWE internship. <br/>
If you're an employer, reach out! (I'm your guy) 👍 <br/>

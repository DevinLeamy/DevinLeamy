### Hi, I'm Devin 👋
I'm a 17 year old student from Calgary, Alberta 🏔 that has a passion for programming. <br/> <br/>
🎓&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm currently studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo and will be graduating with the class of 2025. <br/>
📈&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solving problems with code is what makes me tick and, consequently, it is the skill I am always looking to improve. <br/> 
🚡&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from programming, I enjoy hiking, skiing (the rocky mountains are pretty good for that...), running, and weight lifting. <br/> <br/>

***Note:***<br/>
I'm currently looking for a summer internship. <br/>
If you're an employer, reach out! (I'm your guy) 👍 <br/>
